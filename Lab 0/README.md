## Apriori Algorithm
Implement Apriori algorithm for association rules. Run the algorithm with two different support and confidence levels defined by you.

* Print closed itemset
* Print closed frequent itemset

Let,
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y\subseteq I">
and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X\subseteq Y">
If the X is an infrequent itemset, then Y is also an infrequent itemset. On that basis apply the Apriori algorithm.

Implement the problems using C++/Java. Any of chess, mushroom or retail datasets may be used for the same.
