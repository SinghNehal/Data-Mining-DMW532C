## Modified K-Means Algorithm
```
30 Marks
```
Implement a modified version of K-means where centre of clusters are not centroid but the nearest data point to the centroid. Centroid needs to be updated in each iteration. Use the given data set iris.data.

Hint: Make sure that the class label column is encoded before you process and load the data.

## Radius Neighbour Classifier
```
30 Marks
```
A Radius_Neighbors_Classifier is very similar to K-Neighbors_Classifier with the exception of one parameter. In Radius_Neighbors_Classifier we need to specify the radius of the fixed area used to determine if an observation is a neighbour using radius. In the given data set implement the Radius_Neighbors_Classifier, take r=2 and use the data set iris.data.

Hint: Make sure that the class label column is encoded before you process and load the data.
